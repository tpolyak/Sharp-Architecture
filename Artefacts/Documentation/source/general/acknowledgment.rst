Sharp Architecture attempts to represent the combined wisdom of many
software development giants. Included patterns and algorithms reflect
best practices described by the GoF, Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob Martin,
Steve McConnell, many gurus in the blogosphere and other industry
leaders. Many have been personally involved with helping to shape S#arp
Architecture's current form including and in no paticular order: Alec
Whittington, Chris Richards, Seif Attar, Jon George, Howard van Rooijen,
Billy McCafferty, Frank Laub, Kyle "the coding hillbilly" Baley, Simone
Busoli, Jay Oliver, Lee Carter, Luis Abreu, James Gregory, and Martin
Hornagold ... along with many others who have asked WTF at all the right
times. A special thanks to Roy Bradley who was brave crazy enough to
commission Billy to develop the first version 0.1. Finally, none of this
would have been possible and/or applicable without the tireless, unpaid
efforts of the teams behind projects such as NHibernate, Fluent
NHibernate, NHibernate Validator, MvcContrib, and Castle.
