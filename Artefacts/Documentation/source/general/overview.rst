Overview
========

Pronounced "Sharp Architecture," this is a solid architectural
foundation for rapidly building maintainable web applications leveraging
the ASP.NET MVC framework with NHibernate. The primary advantage to be
sought in using any architectural framework is to decrease the code one
has to write while increasing the quality of the end product. A
framework should enable developers to spend little time on
infrastructure details while allowing them to focus their attentions on
the domain and user experience. Accordingly, S#arp Architecture adheres
to the following key principles:

*  Focused on Domain Driven Design
*  Loosely coupled
*  Preconfigured Infrastructure
*  Open Ended Presentation

The overall goal of this is to allow developers to worry less about
application "plumbing" and to spend most of their time on adding value
for the client by focusing on the business logic and developing a rich
user experience.

Absolutely essential reading is Eric Evans' `Domain Driven Design <http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215>`_. For a
quick introduction to the subject, see `Domain Driven Design Quickly <http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly>`_
which is a concise summary of Evans' classic work. Other useful
background material, albeit dated, includes `NHibernate Best
Practices <http://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/NHibernateBestPractices.aspx>`_.
Although there are major infrastructural changes from the referenced
article when compared to the current S#arp Architecture, the general
structure is very similar and the background reading is helpful in
understanding many of the ideas behind this development foundation.
