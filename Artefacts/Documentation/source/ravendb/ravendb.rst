RavenDB
#######

RavenDB support was added in version 2.1, for sample usage checkout the `SharpArch.TardisBank solution <https://github.com/sharparchitecture/SharpArch.TardisBank/>`_ which is a fork of `Mike Hadlow's Suteki.TardisBank <https://github.com/mikehadlow/Suteki.TardisBank>`_ that was converted to use S#arp Architecture with NHibernate and then converted to work with S#arp Architecture's RavenDB.

The repostiory shows usage of various features of S#arp Architecture, and is a work in progress for a good sample project.

You can start with RavenDB by following the installation steps and using the RavenDB templify template from `S#arp Architecture releases <http://sharparchitecture.net/downloads.htm>`_.

The RavenDB feature provides generic repositories for use with RavenDB and a UnitOfWork attribute, you can learn more about the UnitOfWorkAttribute by following the link below.
