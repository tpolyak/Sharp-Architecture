============

Deploy Sharp Architecture with Templify
---------------------------------------

Download and install `Templify <http://opensource.endjin.com/templify/>`_. Make sure to install the
latest Sharp Architecture package by going to the Sharp Architecture
`Downloads <http://sharparchitecture.github.io/downloads.htm>`_ page and downloading the Templify zip required, currently there are templates for NHibernate and RavenDB.

Extract the contents and run the \*.cmd file to install the package.

Next, select the folder you wish to deploy Sharp Architecture. In our
case, let's create a folder and name the project, IceCreamYouScreamCorp.
After Templify has finished deploying the package, go ahead and launch
the solution in Visual Studio.
