    <h2>Parents</h2>
    <p>You are the bank.</p>
    <p>Tardis bank is a virtual pocket money bank account. It's entirely free, we don't see a penny of your money, it's simply a way for your kids to learn financial literacy. It also makes it much easier for you to keep track of how much pocket money they should be getting.</p>
    <p>After you register, you create accounts for your children and setup a pocket money payment schedule. You can also make additional payments into their account at any time, which is great for Christmas and birthdays. When your child wants to withdraw cash, they click a withdraw button and you will get a message, either by email or by checking your messages on the website, then you hand the money directly to them.</p>
    <p>Register now, it only takes a minute and all we need is your email address (which we won't give out to anyone else).</p>
