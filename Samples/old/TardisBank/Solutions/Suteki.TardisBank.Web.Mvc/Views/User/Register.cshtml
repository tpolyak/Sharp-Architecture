<h2>Parent Sign Up</h2>
<p>Parents, please sign up for Tardis Bank by completing this form. We will then send you an email with a link to activate your account.</p>
<p>After you have signed up, you can create accounts for all your kids.</p>
<p><strong>Kids,</strong> you have to ask a parent to sign up and create an account for you. You can't sign up here by yourself. After all, you need someone to actually give you the money.</p>
