-- 2.0 Release Candidate
--------------------------------------------

This is a release candidate, use at your own risk. Please switch to the 1.9.6.0 for production releases:

$ git checkout 1.9.6.0

--------------------------------------------
-- Templify
--------------------------------------------

We no longer support the use of the Visual Studio templates for installation of S#arp Architecture. With version 2.0, we have dropped support for Visual Studio 2008 altogether. To learn how to get a S#arp Architecture solution up and running, please go to http://blog.sharparchitecture.net/post/Using-Templify-to-create-a-new-Sarp-Architecture-solution.aspx
